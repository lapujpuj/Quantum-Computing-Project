# Bibliographic Project on Quantum Computing

Welcome to my bibliographic project on quantum computing. This project explores the fundamental principles of quantum computing, including the notion of qubits, various technologies for producing and manipulating qubits, as well as quantum optimization and solving classical optimization problems using quantum computers.

  - Measuring a qubit
  - Superposition and entanglement of qubits

- **How to produce a qubit and manipulate its state?**:
  - Trapped-ion qubits
  - Superconducting qubits
  - Photonic qubits

- **Which technology to choose?**

- **Quantum algorithms and optimization**:
  - Quantum gates:
    - Pauli gate
    - Hadamard gate
    - Phase gate
    - CNOT gate
  - Quantum optimization:
    - Adiabatic theorem
    - Ising Hamiltonian

- **Solving an optimization problem: The Max Cut Edge**:
  - Quantum encoding of the problem: Which Hamiltonian?
  - Implementation

- **Conclusion**

The project concludes with a synthesis of the results and perspectives for future research in quantum computing.

## Prerequisites

To work with this project, you will need the following:

- A [D-Wave Leap account](https://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap) for access to D-Wave quantum computers.
- [Ocean](https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/): D-Wave's Python library for solving quantum optimization problems.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [your-github-link]
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook files located in the `partie_pratique/` directory. These files detail the steps required to solve the Max Cut Edge problem using a quantum computer.

## Conclusion

This bibliographic project provides a comprehensive introduction to quantum computing and demonstrates how to use a quantum computer to solve a classical optimization problem. The results highlight the potential of quantum computing to solve complex problems more efficiently than classical algorithms.
