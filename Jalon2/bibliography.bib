	abstract = {These are the lecture notes of the master's course "Quantum Computing", taught at Chalmers University of Technology every fall since 2020, with participation of students from {RWTH} Aachen and Delft University of Technology. The aim of this course is to provide a theoretical overview of quantum computing, excluding specific hardware implementations. Topics covered in these notes include quantum algorithms (such as Grover's algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, phase estimation, and Shor's algorithm), variational quantum algorithms that utilise an interplay between classical and quantum computers [such as the variational quantum eigensolver ({VQE}) and the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm ({QAOA}), among others], quantum error correction, various versions of quantum computing (such as measurement-based quantum computation, adiabatic quantum computation, and the continuous-variable approach to quantum information), the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, and quantum complexity theory. Lectures on these topics are compiled into 12 chapters, most of which contain a few suggested exercises at the end, and interspersed with four tutorials, which provide practical exercises as well as further details. At Chalmers, the course is taught in seven weeks, with three two-hour lectures or tutorials per week. It is recommended that the students taking the course have some previous experience with quantum physics, but not strictly necessary.},

	abstract = {The subject of quantum computing brings together ideas from classical information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to summarise not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum information theory. It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, the review begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then outlined, and the {EPR} experiment described. The {EPR}-Bell correlations, and quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which distinguishes quantum from classical information theory, and, arguably, quantum from classical physics. Basic quantum information ideas are described, including key distribution, teleportation, data compression, quantum error correction, the universal quantum computer and quantum algorithms. The common theme of all these ideas is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational resource. Experimental methods for small quantum processors are briefly sketched, concentrating on ion traps, high Q cavities, and {NMR}. The review concludes with an outline of the main features of quantum information physics, and avenues for future research.},

Our aim is to assist developers in understanding the impact of the specific properties of these devices on the effectiveness of algorithm execution. Based on discussions with different vendors and recent literature, we discuss the performance data of the neutral atom platform. Specifically, we focus on the physical qubit architecture, which affects state preparation, qubit-to-qubit connectivity, gate fidelities, native gate instruction set, and individual qubit stability. These factors determine both the quantum-part execution time and the end-to-end wall clock time relevant for end-users, but also the ability to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation in the future. We end with an overview of which applications have been shown to be well suited for the peculiar properties of neutral atom-based quantum computers.},

It is found the quantum annealer can only handle a problem size of 8 or less nodes and its performance is subpar compared to the classical solver both in terms of time and accuracy.},

	abstract = {One of the most popular approaches being pursued to achieve a quantum advantage with practical hardware are superconducting circuit devices. Although signiﬁcant progress has been made over the previous two decades, substantial engineering efforts are required to scale these devices so they can be used to solve many problems of interest. Unfortunately, much of this exciting ﬁeld is described using technical jargon and concepts from physics that are unfamiliar to a classically trained electromagnetic engineer. As a result, this work is often difﬁcult for engineers to become engaged in. We hope to lower the barrier to this ﬁeld by providing an accessible review of one of the most prevalently used quantum bits (qubits) in superconducting circuit systems, the transmon qubit. Most of the physics of these systems can be understood intuitively with only some background in quantum mechanics. As a result, we avoid invoking quantum mechanical concepts except where it is necessary to ease the transition between details in this work and those that would be encountered in the literature. We believe this leads to a gentler introduction to this fascinating ﬁeld, and hope that more researchers from the classical electromagnetic community become engaged in this area in the future.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2305.09518},
	abstract = {In 2017, John Preskill defined Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum ({NISQ}) computers as an intermediate step on the road to large scale error corrected fault-tolerant quantum computers ({FTQC}). The {NISQ} regime corresponds to noisy qubit quantum computers with the potential to solve actual problems of some commercial value faster than conventional supercomputers, or consuming less energy. Over five years on, it is a good time to review the situation. While rapid progress is being made with quantum hardware and algorithms, and many recent experimental demonstrations, no one has yet successfully implemented a use case matching the original definition of the {NISQ} regime. This paper investigates the space, fidelity and time resources of various {NISQ} algorithms and highlights several contradictions between {NISQ} requirements and actual as well as future quantum hardware capabilities. It then covers various techniques which could help like qubit fidelities improvements, various breeds of quantum error mitigation methods, analog/digital hybridization, using specific qubit types like multimode photons as well as quantum annealers and analog quantum computers (aka quantum simulators or programmable Hamiltonian simulators) which seem closer to delivering useful applications although they have their own mid to longer-term scalability challenges. Given all the constraints of these various solutions, it seems possible to expect some practical use cases for {NISQ} systems, but with a very narrow window before various scaling issues show up. Turning to the future, a scenario can be envisioned where {NISQ} will not necessarily be an intermediate step on the road to {FTQC}. Instead, the two may develop along different paths, due to their different requirements. This leaves open a key question on the trade-offs that may be necessary to make between qubit scale and qubit fidelities in future quantum computers designs.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of physical errors1–3 prevents the execution of large-scale algorithms in current quantum computers. Quantum error correction4 promises a solution by encoding k logical qubits onto a larger number n of physical qubits, such that the physical errors are suppressed enough to allow running a desired computation with tolerable fidelity. Quantum error correction becomes practically realizable once the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on the choice of quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit and decoding algorithm5. We present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes6. Our approach achieves an error threshold of 0.7\% for the standard circuit-based noise model, on par with the surface code7–10 that for 20 years was the leading code in terms of error threshold. The syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-8 circuit with {CNOT} gates, qubit initializations and measurements. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph composed of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. In particular, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for nearly 1 million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of 0.1\%, whereas the surface code would require nearly 3,000 physical qubits to achieve said performance. Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.},
