	abstract = {These are the lecture notes of the master's course "Quantum Computing", taught at Chalmers University of Technology every fall since 2020, with participation of students from {RWTH} Aachen and Delft University of Technology. The aim of this course is to provide a theoretical overview of quantum computing, excluding specific hardware implementations. Topics covered in these notes include quantum algorithms (such as Grover's algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, phase estimation, and Shor's algorithm), variational quantum algorithms that utilise an interplay between classical and quantum computers [such as the variational quantum eigensolver ({VQE}) and the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm ({QAOA}), among others], quantum error correction, various versions of quantum computing (such as measurement-based quantum computation, adiabatic quantum computation, and the continuous-variable approach to quantum information), the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, and quantum complexity theory. Lectures on these topics are compiled into 12 chapters, most of which contain a few suggested exercises at the end, and interspersed with four tutorials, which provide practical exercises as well as further details. At Chalmers, the course is taught in seven weeks, with three two-hour lectures or tutorials per week. It is recommended that the students taking the course have some previous experience with quantum physics, but not strictly necessary.},

	abstract = {The subject of quantum computing brings together ideas from classical information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to summarise not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum information theory. It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, the review begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then outlined, and the {EPR} experiment described. The {EPR}-Bell correlations, and quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which distinguishes quantum from classical information theory, and, arguably, quantum from classical physics. Basic quantum information ideas are described, including key distribution, teleportation, data compression, quantum error correction, the universal quantum computer and quantum algorithms. The common theme of all these ideas is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational resource. Experimental methods for small quantum processors are briefly sketched, concentrating on ion traps, high Q cavities, and {NMR}. The review concludes with an outline of the main features of quantum information physics, and avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {We present an industrial end-user perspective on the current state of quantum computing hardware for one specific technological approach, the neutral atom platform. Our aim is to assist developers in understanding the impact of the specific properties of these devices on the effectiveness of algorithm execution. Based on discussions with different vendors and recent literature, we discuss the performance data of the neutral atom platform. Specifically, we focus on the physical qubit architecture, which affects state preparation, qubit-to-qubit connectivity, gate fidelities, native gate instruction set, and individual qubit stability. These factors determine both the quantum-part execution time and the end-to-end wall clock time relevant for end-users, but also the ability to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation in the future. We end with an overview of which applications have been shown to be well suited for the peculiar properties of neutral atom-based quantum computers.},

	abstract = {The traveling salesman problem is a well-known {NP}-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. This paper shows how to solve it on an Ising Hamiltonian based quantum annealer by casting it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization ({QUBO}) problem. Results of practical experiments are also presented using D-Wave’s 5,000 qubit Advantage 1.1 quantum annealer and the performance is compared to a classical solver. It is found the quantum annealer can only handle a problem size of 8 or less nodes and its performance is subpar compared to the classical solver both in terms of time and accuracy.},
